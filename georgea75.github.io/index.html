    <p>Hey, my name is George Alexander and I am a software engineer. This website currently serves as a place to hold my CV and showcase my music projects.</p>
    <p>I am interested in how software can be used to improve decision-making. Particularly in the fields of Economics, Geography and Finance. I am interested in these domains and obtained degrees in Economics and Geography alongside Computer Science. So far I have been lucky to always hold roles related to these disciplines.</p>
    <p>I have been working with geospatial technology since university. I have experience with traditional GIS software but my primary interest is in "Modern GIS." I have experience with most of the Python geospatial stack and am currently involved in efforts to manage carbon projects using machine learning and remote sensing at ClimateFriendly. </p>
