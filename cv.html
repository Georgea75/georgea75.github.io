    <p>I am a motivated software engineer who specialises in building data-intensive applications to support decision-making. I specialise in building systems that align with my domain interests in geography, economics, and finance. So far in my career, I have worked on city simulation, solar panel technology, and carbon farming. </p>
    <h2> Technology.</h2>
    I am always interested in learning new things, but I have professional experience with:
    <li> <strong>Geospatial technology:</strong> ESRI, QGIS, Manifold, Rasterio, Shapely, GDAL, PDAL, STAC, TiTiler </li>
    <li> <strong>Data Engineering:</strong> Dask, Coiled, Spark</li>
    <li> <strong>Machine learning systems:</strong> MLFlow, Tensorflow, PyTorch</li>
    <li> <strong>Containerisation:</strong> Nix, Docker</li>
    <li> <strong>Cloud:</strong> Azure, AWS</li>
    <li> <strong>Databases:</strong> Postgres (PostGIS), TileDB</li>
    <li> <strong>API development:</strong> FastAPI, Flask</li>
    <li> <strong>Programing languages:</strong> Python, Rust, and Java</li>
    <li> <strong>Development best practices:</strong> Linting, Git, Testing, Github actions (CICD), Jira</li>
    <h2>Experience.</h2>
    <h3> ClimateFriendly, Software Engineer</h3>
    <p>I am a software engineer in the geospatial development team. I am responsible for software that manages and tracks carbon farming projects across Australia. My responsibilities include MLOps, data pipelines (Dask),  geospatial data stores (PostGIS and TileDB) and API development (FastAPI). </p>
    <h3> Arup, Software Engineer</h3>
    <p>I worked within the Australasian City Modelling Labs building large agent-based models built around the MATSim simulation framework. These models simulate the actions of individual agents across a transport network. The simulation pipeline utilised hundreds of large datasets to generate actionable insights for policy and investment teams. I built and maintained simulation capabilities, ETL pipelines, orchestration systems, and databases. </p>
    <h3>Solar City, Geospatial Data Officer</h3>
    <p>I worked as part of Solar Cityâ€™s GIS team to identify roofs that were candidates for solar panels. This identification task used a mix of remote sensing and the development of an image classification program. This dataset was then used to identify the size of the New Zealand solar panel market, and for a targeted marketing program.</p>
    <h3>Common Ground, Research Assistant </h3>
    <p>I worked as a research assistant building feasibility studies and business cases for mixed-use developments. </p>
